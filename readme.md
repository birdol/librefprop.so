#Welcome to librefprop.so!
These files allow you to compile the Refprop fluid property database as a shared library for Linux and MacOS systems. This enables you to use the Fortran sources developed by NIST providing an alternative to the refprop.dll for Windows. 

## Installation Instructions
For installation on a Linux or OSX machine, please follow the steps described below. By default, the library and the header file are placed in system directories. Please change the paths if you do not have write access to this part of your file system. 

0.  Make sure that you have gcc, for OSX use [HPC](http://hpc.sourceforge.net/) and install the [OSX command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads).
1.  Change the paths in the Makefile, if needed.
2.  Copy the Refprop Fortran code to the *fortran* directory.
3.  Put the *fluids* and *mixtures* folders from Refprop into the *files* folder.
4.  Call `make header library` to prepare the files. 
5.  Use `make install` (as root user) to copy the files to the destination directories.

You can remove the files again by calling `make uninstall` (as root user). 

## Testing the Installation
There is a simple Fortran file to test the library. You can call `make fortest` and run the executable with `./bin/ex_mix_for` to display some R410 two-phase properties:

| Temperature | Pressure  | Density, liquid | Density, vapour |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 300.0000    | 1740.5894 |   14.4550       |   0.9628        |
| 300.0000    | 1735.1589 |   14.2345       |   0.9603        |


## Python Integration
There is a basic python package based on the examples from
[NIST](http://www.boulder.nist.gov/div838/theory/refprop/Frequently_asked_questions.htm#PythonApplications "NIST homepage")
in the `pyrp` folder. 

Please note that there is a much more mature Python interface available at https://github.com/BenThelen/python-refprop. Thank you Ben for sharing it!

## Matlab Integration
There is a Matlab prototype file available from
[NIST](http://www.boulder.nist.gov/div838/theory/refprop/Frequently_asked_questions.htm#MatLabApplications "NIST homepage"). Unfortunately, you have to change a few things in order to use the 
library on MacOS and Linux. There is a shell script in the `matlab` folder that can do all the foot work for you. You only have
to put the files `refpropm.m`, `rp_proto64.m` and `rp_proto.m` into the `matlab` folder and run `fixfiles.sh`. Enjoy your new library.


## General Remarks
Please note that you need a working and licensed copy of Refprop in order to use the software provided here. This is not a replacement for Refprop. You can purchase Refprop at http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist23.cfm
